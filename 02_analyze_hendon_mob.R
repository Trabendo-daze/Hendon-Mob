# Fields
# 
# Some fields in the summary dataframe are scraped directly, others are modified
# using post-hoc manipulation. The list of all of the fields which are in the 
# summary dataframe are is the following. 
# 
# 
# 
# 1. **name** - Play√©r's name
# 2. **nationality** - Player's nationality
# 3. **average_buy_in** - Player's average buy-in, in USD
# 
# i) Note that this item is imperfect because buy-in is not always listed,
# and when it is, sometimes the currency is difficult to guess. I assume here that
# the currency of the buy-in is in the currency of the country of the tournament,
# however this is not always true (and there is currently no better way). For example,
# some events in Ukraine transacted with USD, others with Ukrainian Hryvnia. Since
# I automatically convert all foreign currency to USD based on 2017 exchange rates,
# this results in some values being converted which actually did not need to be, and 
# therefore in the buy-in values being wrong. 
# 
# 4. **number_of_cashes** - Number of events cashed in career
# 5. **sum_of_cashes** - Total amount of money cashed for in poker career, in USD
# 6. **average_cash** - Average amount cashed for per tournament
# 7. **average_placement** - Average placement in tournaments
# 8. **number_of_binks** - A bink is poker slang for a sizeable tournament poker score.
# There's no agreed upon definition of a bink, but I define it here as any cash
# above 20 times the average buy-in. This field counts all of those cashes. For
# the reasons noted above, this field is somewhat unreliable since it depends on
# average buy-in.
# 
# 9. **binks_proportion** - The percentage of tournament cashes that were binks
# 10. **number_of_countries_cashed** - The number of distinct countries that a player
# had a tournament cash in.
# 11. **first_date** - The date of the earliest tournament cash for a player.
# 12. **last_date** - The date of the most recent tournament cash for a player.
# 13. **years_played** - The difference between the date of a player's most recent cash
# and their first cash, in years. Note that this does not assume that the player 
# has continued to play since their last cash.
# 14. **average_time_btwn_cash** - The average number of days between a player's cashes,
# determined by using the first and last cashes as the endpoints
# 15. **unique_views** - Number of unique views of the player's profile
# 16. **quantile** - Players are separated into 4 quartiles based on their total cashes.
# Players in quartile 1 are the 25% of players with the least amount of cashes, 
# while players in quartile 4 are the 25% of players with the most amount of cashes.
